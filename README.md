LadderFramework
===============
This isn't a framwork for you to use. It's by no means production ready. There are many great framworks and toolkits that you should look at before even waisting time on this one. 

Stop reading! 

*Go away!*

Still here? 

I'm a fool for writing this code as there are thousands of bright people that have created great frameworks. So why do I spend time doing this? I could say that other frameworks are horrible but they are not. However I think that different developers have had to make a lot of decisions. By writing this code I would have to make these decisions as well. It would provide me with better understanding of other frameworks as well. 

As you are still reading I would like to point out that this code is _abandonware_ and not software.
